      <h1>The Watcher</h1>
      <p>The Watchers is an ancient being, from an older earth long forgetten. It's kind use to populate the skies, genreating the many clouds we see today. They lived in they skies controlling the plaents weather on a whim. With the bat of their eye they could generate thunder and lightning. No one know ones what has become of these beings, some speculate that these beings still exist, they have just only went into hiding because of human kind pollution of the skies. Maybe one day, when the skies clear of smog, the watchers will return.</p>
